# sonus-auris-site.web

Marketing website for **Sonus Auris** — *a dashcam for audio*. An always-on
recording app that keeps a rolling buffer of your audio and backs it up,
encrypted, to the cloud. Built for musicians who don't want to lose the riff,
and for anyone who wants an honest record when memory isn't enough.

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build). No client framework — just fast,
static HTML/CSS with a little inline SVG animation.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:4321
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build    # outputs to ./dist
npm run preview  # preview the production build
```

Each directory also has its own `README.md` describing what lives there.

## Things to wire up before launch

- `StoreButtons.astro` — replace `APPLE_URL` / `GOOGLE_URL` with real listings.
- GitHub links point to `github.com/sonus-auris/sonus-auris` — update if the
  org/repo name differs.
- `astro.config.mjs` `site` — set to the real production domain.
- `Partners.astro` — the footer row now shows **neutral capability badges**
  (Sound matching, Sleep & snore, Music capture, Clear audio), NOT third-party
  endorsements. Do not reintroduce real organisation/brand names without written
  permission — that would imply an affiliation Sonus Auris does not have.
- Legal pages (`privacy.astro`, `account-deletion.astro`) have placeholder
  legal-entity name, contact email, and postal address to fill before store
  submission; a visible "Before publishing" banner shows while placeholders remain.

## Theme

Green + orange, rounded **Baloo 2** type, music / party / driving cartoon
doodles. Fun but professional.
